# Age distribution algorithm

Inspired by the example of the included AgeDistribution java class, I have come up with an algorithm to expand my group's age distribution to a thousand people.

Firstly the share of each age should evaluated as a percentage of the whole. Next a random number generator should draw numbers and add people to said age brackets based on set probability weights.
